The doubts that have been mentioned and any/all content is just for reference purposes. This is not endorsed by the Instructor/TAs/Institution	. So the questions/answers might be incomplete or incorrect. This is just made to ease out the process of reading the many discussions on BackPack whenever submitting the assignment. (Though I recommend you to go through it at least once so that if there is anything missing here, you are able to include that)

Feel Free to send PRs :D
