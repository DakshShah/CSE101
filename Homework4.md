## Input

Ques: Does the user needs to give us the input or we have to declare the array in the script itself? 

Ans. You can create an array in the script itself. 

## Submission (One per team)

Mention your partner's name in the modules and zip the files with roll numbers of both the members:
Eg.: 2017xxx_2017yyy_HW4.zip

## Clarifications

### Meaning of double is a floating point number, it can be negaitive as well.

### Rank taken as no. of columns, has some problem in it. You could fix the errror that comes by taking the transpose of matrix

(Do it as mentioned in the document. You can then transpose the matrix and repeat the same steps. Report the minimum of two as the final answer.)


## FAQ

### Can I create my own function?

Ans. Yes you can create other functions as well. There is no restriction on that.

### Do we only have to consider square matrices?

No, it can be rectangular.  You may need to transpose the matrix to get correct answer.


### Do we need to follow the pseudocode strictly? 

You need to use row reduce echelon form. In addition implement all the functions asked in the document. If you see some minor issue in the pseudo code you can fix that in your implementation.



###  Is it necessary to use transpose? Because even without it, the program is working fine (if we assign rank to be the minimum of number of columns and rows).

Ans. I had suggested just one way to fix the problem. You can use minimum of rows and columns as well. 

### To how many places should we round off each element in the matrix after performing some operation?

Ans. As long as you give a correct output, I do not care for the rounding operation.

### In the handout, 2.b).(ii) says that we should remove the column by swapping it with the last column. Is this where the transpose is required (as column operations are not allowed)? Also, is this step necessary as the program is working fine without it.

Ans. I can not relate it to transpose as you have asked. In case you do not require this step, do not use it in your main function.
